R for Rotating along the x axis of the mesh itself

X for toggling moving along the Positive X axis

C for toggling moving along the Negative X axis

Y for toggling moving along the Positive Y axis

U for toggling moving along the Negative Y axis

Z for toggling moving along the Positive Z axis

A for toggling moving along the Negative Z axis
